# Hi, Iâ€™m Prajakta Ghonmode ðŸ‘‹

(you might know me online as ScarletWriter)

Iâ€™m a technical writer with over 3+ years of experience creating documentation that actually helps people, from **user manuals** and **quick start guides** to **API docs** and **troubleshooting guides.**

I enjoy working with software teams, digging into how things work, and turning all that technical complexity into something clear and useful for users. Writing for me isnâ€™t just about explaining features, itâ€™s about helping someone get unstuck and feel confident using a product.

This space is where I share my sample work, experiments, and a bit of what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.
